  <comment>Some of our customers use windows.  I've never run across this problem, and the only mention of it is a comment on an old ticket for an unrelated issue (https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/2177).  

Thanks for posting your plugin. I've recently been struggling with similar base64 issues (in cases where a random hex wouldn't make sense), so I can see why this might cause problems.  I'm not sure why base64 is even used, I seem to recall using SHA hex strings when I wrote it.  Patches do help move the contribution process long though.</comment>
