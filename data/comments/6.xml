  <comment>I think the main reason you haven't seen is, is because the problem only occurs when the Base64 string contains chars which aren't appreciated by IE(6). This isn't always the case.

The problem is so intermittent that it is accepted as just an other minor error  (thank you Microsoft!) by most users.</comment>
