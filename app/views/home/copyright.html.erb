      <li>You have every right to copy the contents from this site. As far
        as I am concerned this site is a public place. Everything on it
        that you can access without a key is yours for the taking.</li>

      <li>If I have placed anything private on here but forgot to crypt
        it; That is my bad.</li>

      <li>Just make sure that you place a neat little link back to where
        you found your warez and that you make them freely available as
        well</li>

      <li>Yes, everything is free. But it is free as in speech. Not as
        in beer. And with freedom of speech comes responsibility. Ponder
        that for a few seconds.</li>

      <li>In that light; if you use my content to create anything hurt-
        or harmful I will retain the right to revoke the licenses given
        to you.</li>
