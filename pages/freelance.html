<h2>Gun, not for hire</h2>

<p>At the moment I am fully employed at <a

NL and are not available for freelance assignments.</p>

<p>But I have some time to spare sometimes and like to make an extra
buck (who doesn't?), so for small assignments I might just be
interrested. If you are not sure wheter you have a small assignment,
then don't be hesitant to <a href="/home/contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
