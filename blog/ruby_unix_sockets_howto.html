<!-- title: Ruby UNIX Sockets Howto -->

<!-- tags: ruby, unix sockets, howto, zsh -->

<p>Yesterday I was trying do put some good old UNIX voodoo to use and make a
socket to notify there was a new push to a git repo, so it could be automaticly
deployed as another user. Of course set-user-id scripts can do this, but they
are not really safe. I wanted to do this in ruby as gitolite is to much Perl
already and I'm done with Perl.</p>

<p>When looking for a howto, i found very little info. Sure... There was enough
about <code>AF_INET</code> sockets, but <code>AF_UNIX</code> seems under
appreciated...</p>

<p>Combining old knowledge and freshly found informations i cooked up
something like this:
</p>

<code language="ruby">require 'socket'

# make sure everybody can write to my socket
File.umask 0000

file = "/var/run/my/socket.sock"
File.unlink(file) if File.exists?(file)

server = UNIXServer.open(file)
  
loop {
  $stderr.puts "[server] Awaiting new connection"

  # server.accept is blocking, so the loop wont loop and eat your bogomips.
  # Once the thread is started, the loop runs once and the server awaits a 
  # new connection
  #
  Thread.start(server.accept) do |client|
    # get(s) a question from the client
    question = client.gets.chomp

    # give the client her answer
    answer = question.gsub '?', '!'
    client.puts answer

    # close the connection to the client
    client.close

    # if you want, you can do time and resource consuming things here
    sleep 5
    $stderr.puts "[server] Closing thread"
  end
}
</code>

<p>And here is some client code to go with it</p>

<code language="ruby">require 'socket'

file = "/var/run/my/socket.sock"
socket = UNIXSocket.new(file)

socket.puts "Hello?"
response = socket.gets

$stderr.puts "The server said: #{response}"
</code>

<p>When you run this, you should get some output like below:</p>

<pre>
~ % ruby server.rb &
[server] Awaiting new connection
~ % ruby client.rb
[server] Awaiting new connection
The server said: Hello!
~ % [server] Closing thread

</pre>

<p>And if you love zsh like me, you can even test that the multi-threading
works as expected with a nice globbing/foreach trick</p>

<pre>
~ % foreach a ( {1..10} ) { ruby client.rb & }
[3] 7543
[4] 7544
[5] 7545
Awaiting new connection
The server said: Hello!
[6] 7546
[4]    done       ruby client.rb
Awaiting new connection
The server said: Hello!
[4] 7547
[3]    done       ruby client.rb
Awaiting new connection
The server said: Hello!
[3] 7548
[6]  - done       ruby client.rb
Awaiting new connection
The server said: Hello!
[6] 7549
[7] 7550
[5]    done       ruby client.rb
[5] 7551
Awaiting new connection
Awaiting new connection
[8] 7552
~ % Awaiting new connection
The server said: Hello!

[3]    done       ruby client.rb
~ % Awaiting new connection
The server said: Hello!

[4]    done       ruby client.rb
~ % Awaiting new connection
The server said: Hello!
The server said: Hello!

[8]  + done       ruby client.rb
~ % The server said: Hello!

[6]  - done       ruby client.rb
~ %
[7]  + done       ruby client.rb
~ % Awaiting new connection
The server said: Hello!

[5]  + done       ruby client.rb
~ % Closing thread
Closing thread
Closing thread
Closing thread
Closing thread
Closing thread
Closing thread
Closing thread
Closing thread
Closing thread

</pre>

<p>Hurray! It works (if you don't have a globbing shell, you can copy/paste
<code>ruby client.rb &</code> 10 times on one line to get the same effect)
Now just add some code to deamonize it and off you go.</p>

<p>PS: Did you know you can pass file-descriptors through a UNIX socket? I
still need the time to get it figured out, if you know how - let me know!</p>
