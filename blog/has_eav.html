<p>While EAV (Entity Attribute Value; see
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-attribute-value_model">Wikipedia</a>)
  might not be the best solution for everything, it might be needed sometimes. 
  It can also make your live easier when doing STI (Single Table Inheritance) - inherited objects
  might want to add new attributes and not only a distinguishing type and EAV can help you there.
</p>
<p>In Rails-2.3.x I used <a href="https://github.com/visfleet/acts_as_eav_model">acts_as_eav_model</a>
  for this purpose. It was hastily made ready for Rails-3, and as it passes all it's own specs, 
  but it has a nasty <a href="https://github.com/visfleet/acts_as_eav_model/issues#issue/3">bug
    that I reported</a> the other day. I forked it and tried to fix things, but acts_as_eav_model 
    is rather complex in it's setup and is geared to the database (1 base table can have several
    AV tables). So I took the short way out, DIY. Within a day I had created the desired behavior
    on my model, distilled it into a reusable module, then into gem and had it
    <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/has_eav">published</a>.

<p>I tried to make has_eav act natural for the rails developer, but (intentionally) introduced 
  2 major drawbacks;
  <ul>
    <li>You have to roll your own migration for the attributes model.</li>
    <li>You must specify the attributes.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>This is done because, has_eav is to be specified on an existing model that needs rails behaviour
  - the setup is as follows:</p>
<pre><code language="ruby">class Residence &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_eav :through =&gt; :residence_attribute do
    eav_attribute :kitchen_size
    eav_attribute :room_size
    eav_attribute :bathroom_size
    # ...
    eav_attribute :garden_size
  end
end

class ResidenceAttribute
  belongs_to :residence
end</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the hood has_eav performs a 
  <code language="ruby">ResidenceAttribute.all.where( :residence_id =&gt; self.id )</code> to load the defined
  attribute/value pairs. (It does so lazily, no attributes are loaded until one is actually
  requested)
</p>
