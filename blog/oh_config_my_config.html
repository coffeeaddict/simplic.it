<p>The Magento instance we have at work is somehow un-updateable.
  This means that we have to perform a major overhaul to get to the latest of
  versions, which we should obviously have for a gazillion reasons.</p>

<p>So, I got myself a fresh and shiney new 1.4.2.0 copy and happily started 
  installation. No go.</p>

<p>Browsing around the Magento community (which is barely alive) there where
  others reporting the same problem and they had come to the notion that a
  specific PHP and a specific MySQL version would solve the problem.</p>
  
<p>So I yum updated the local PHP. No party. And worse; deprecation warnings
  and broken shops all over the place. Luckily only the <code>split()</code>
  needed an update, so <a href="http://betterthangrep.com/">ack</a> and $EDITOR
  to the rescue to replace all those instances of
  <code>split('.', $string)</code> with <code>preg_split(/\./, $string)</code>.
</p>

<p>This morning, before business hours, I boldly went forth and updated the
  MySQL server to the latest my yum repo's had to offer. I was more fortunate 
  then the last time I touched MySQL; back then it lost notion of it's ibdata
  files. That took me a some sweaty minutes to get figured out and fixed. But
  this morning, everything went peachy.
</p>

<p>Just to be sure, I disabled everything before the upgrade using this nifty
  lil' Nginx config</p>

<code language="nginx">
  # MAINTENANCE
  #
  # Catch-all server that always says: Maintenance
  #
  server {
    listen 1.2.3.4:80 default;
    server_name _;

    location / {
      return 503;
    }

    error_page 503 @maintenance;

    location @maintenance {
      root /opt/nginx/html;
      rewrite ^(.*)$ /503.html break;
    }
  }
</code>

<p>And made sure that I had that 503.html in place with a nice
  mea-culpa-maintenance message</p>
  
<p>So, now let's try and install that new magento again. <em>No go.</em></p>

<p>So I downloaded, compiled, tested (some tests failed) and installed 
  PHP 5.2.17. <strong>No go.</strong></p>

<p>Then I tried the same with a PHP from the museum (no kiddin! When you want 
  and older PHP version, you download it from
  <a href="http://museum.php.net/php5/">museum.php.net</a>) and reverted to 
  PHP 5.2.6 - someone had some success with that. 
  <strong><em>No go!</em></strong></p>

<p>By now I had passed my self imposed coffee quotum and started to get a tad
  angry with this stupid-excuse-for-a-scripting-language and this 
  grosely-overpowered-e-commerce-platform with all it's dark-magic PHP and 
  voodoo call-chains</p>

<p>I started to sniff up the code and came to the conclusion that in order for
  Magento to make a Magento configuration file, it needs a valid configuration
  file. And the default configuration file provided with the full download ...
  <span class="large alt">Is not valid... The pain. The agony.</span>

<p>So I copied over the config.xml file from our existing 1.3.x install and
  tried again. And there it went. Running on PHP 5.3.x and a fresh MySQL and it
  installed. <em>Well, Almost...</em>
<p>

<p>Obviously, the 1.3.x config files are not upwards compatible so at the end of
 the installation process things broke again. I merged the 2 config files, 
 adding the right/needed xml tags and started again. <strong>Go! Go!</strong>
</p>

<p>In my anger I forgot to document what tags where missing. If I ever have to 
  go through this again (And I actualy hope not) I will be making notes so that
  I can share the knowledge. For now I hope to have gotten you in the right
  direction if you have stumbled upon the same problem.</p>
