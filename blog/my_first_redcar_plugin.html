<p>An odd couple of weeks ago I tried <code>gem install redcar</code>
once more.</p>

<p>I had tried it before, but the editor was not in a workable state
back then and I was more then satisfied with Netbeans as a Rails
development platform. But as my projects grew, so did the monstrous
memory consumption of Netbeans bringing it to a grinding halt on my
measly 2Gig system if I dared open a couple of projects at the same
time; which I tend to do, as I am working on a some what Service
Oriented Application-network</p>

<p>I switched almost instantly. Which is a big achievement for an
editor! The only thing I dearly missed from Netbeans was jumping to
the associated Rails file, when in an action inside a controller, open
the according view instantly for instance.</p>

<p>So I /join'ed the #redcar channel on irc.freenode.org and asked
around a bit about making a plugin and was up and running in no
time.</p>

<p>And now is the time to decide where this blog should go; tell
something about plugins, or tell you about the struggles I had with my
plugin. I will stick with the first, as it addresses some of my
problems as well. And besides; my plugin is not done yet. If you are
interested in the struggle with my plugin, just read the commit log on
<a
href="https://github.com/coffeeaddict/redcar_associated_file">github</a>. I
started pushing to github the instant I started developing
(almost)</p>

<h3>Begin</h3>

<p>To break the drag of programming, you might want to be enlightend
by some wisdom, so we are going to make a neat little plugin to show a
message box with a fortune in it.</p>

<p>First we need something of a layout to place the files in. Not
wanting to be the authoritive source for this, but it seems like the
following layout is the de facto standard:</p>

<pre><code>your_project/.
your_project/plugin.rb
your_project/lib/
your_project/lib/your_project.rb
your_project/lib/your_project/
your_project/lib/your_project/show_wisdom.rb</code></pre>

<p>The basic layout for any ruby project actually...</p>

<h3>The setup</h3>

<p>The <code>plugin.rb</code> file tells Redcar what to expect and do. It should look a little somethin' like this:
<br />
<code language="ruby">
Plugin.define do
  name         "your_project"
  version      "1.0.0"   # be proud of what you make - release as 1.0!
  file         "lib", "your_project"
  object       "Redcar::YourProject"
  dependencies ""
end
</code></p>

<p>I could take you line-by-line, but I think the DSL Dan created here
is pretty straight forward. What is nice to know is that the
<code>lib</code> part of the file definition is pushed onto
<code>$AUTO_LOAD</code> so you can include other related files more
easily.</p>

<h3>The commander</h3>

<p>I will limit this HOWTO to a command, basicly because I haven't had
the time to look at other aspects yet (like tasks). A command can be
executed from the menu and bound to a key stroke. I will show you
both.</p>

<p>First, let's define the skeleton of the plugin. We must define the
menus and the key-bindings.<br />
<code language="ruby">
module Redcar
  class YourProject
    def self.menus
    end

    def self.keymaps
    end
  end
end
</code><br />

The both of them are tied to a 'Command' class. I will show you the
command class next. What is going here holds little secrets:
Once redcar loads the plugin class <code>Redcar::YourProject</code>
it executes the class methods 'menus' and 'keymaps' to get things
going.</p>

<h3>The command</h3>

<p>Let's first define a simple command class placed in
<code>lib/your_project/show_wisdom.rb</code>. Remember, we are only going to display some wisdom, so it should be as straightforward as this:
<br />
<code language="ruby">
module Redcar
  class YourProject
    class ShowWisdom < Command
      def execute
        # perhaps you must install fortune for your system and perhaps it is
        # not located in '/usr/games'
        #
        message = `/usr/games/fortune`
        Application::Dialog.message_box(message)
      end
    end
  end
end
</code>
<br />

<em class="alt">I know, back-ticks are evil. But this is all for the
purpose of demonstration. If you know better, then do better.</em>
<br />
<br />
We inherit from Command and have to implement the execute method and
now; it works. It just works.
</p>

<h3>Tie it up</h3>

<p>Back to our plugin class! We want to tie this thing into a menu
real quick so we can enjoy some good wisdom. This is again very
straight forward (Dan has done a good job on those DSL's
<em>*hat-tip*</em><br />

<code language="ruby">
require 'your_project/show_wisdom.rb';

module Redcar
  class YourProject
    def self.menus
      Menu::Builder.build do
        sub_menu "View" do
          item "Show me wisdom", YourProject::ShowWisdom
        end
      end
    end

  end
end
</code><br />

What this does is open the existing definitions for the View menu and
add another item called 'Show me wisdom' which is tied to our ShowWisdom
class. Once the item gets clicked, the ShowWisdom class is instantiated
and 'execute' is called on the instance, which in term should render a
fortune on screen.</p>

<p>Now, let's tie the same command class to a keystroke<br />
<code language="ruby">
    # ...

    def self.keymaps
      linwin = Keymap.build("main", [ :linux, :windows ]) do
        link "Ctrl+Alt+F", YourProject::ShowWisdom
      end
      osx = Keymap.build("main", :osx) do
        link "Cmd+Alt+F", YourProject::ShowWisdom
      end

      # return a list of bindings
      [linwin, osx]
    end

    # ...
</code>
<br />

I have to be honest and admit that I do not know what 'main' does, but
I can guess. Can you?</p>

<h3>Test ride</h3>

<p>So now that the demonstration plugin is ready, let's take the
little red car for a spin with fortune-wisdom included.</p>

<p>Copy or symlink the contents of the plugin directory (that is the
one including plugin.rb) into
<code>$HOME/.redcar/plugins</code>. (Re)start redcar and see if it
works...</p>

<h3>The wrap up</h3>

<p>You need only your imagination now to make beautiful plugins.</p>

<p>There is however one big cave-at: <strong>Gems</strong>. Since
Redcar runs inside of it's own bundled jruby you cannot access the
gems you have installed. And depending on gems becomes difficult. So
vendoring in is the way I went forth, but perhaps with some trickery
you could tell rubygems where to find the right dependencies.</p>
